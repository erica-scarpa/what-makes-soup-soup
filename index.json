Provenance refers to the ownership history of a historical artifact, tracing its journey through time and the various hands that have held it. In contrast, provenience specifically denotes the findspot—the exact physical location where the artifact was discovered. While provenance logically encompasses provenience, it also extends further, including details about the artifact\u0026rsquo;s custody and the transitions it may have undergone throughout its history.\nSubparagraph # Nunc lacinia eget nisl id porttitor.

The main topic will be the application of Semantic Web (SW) technologies in the wider field of Heritage Science. A panel of domain experts - coming from archaeological, historical, and epigraphic disciplines - and knowledge engineers will participate. The discussion will be centered on the potential of applying SW technologies to large archaeological, historical, and epigraphic datasets. This is the first meeting devoted to fostering collaboration in building an ontology for Heritage Science. Further meetings will be held, including domain experts working with Heritage coming from the natural sciences.\nFor further information, see this link.\nThe post featured image is from Tableaux accomplis de tous les arts liberaux by Christofle de Savigny (ca 1530-1608) gallica.bnf.fr / Bibliothèque nationale de France.\n","date":"15 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/what-makes-soup-soup/posts/round-table-venice/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Heritage Science and Semantic Web - Venice Round Table","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"15 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/what-makes-soup-soup/tags/semantic-web/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Semantic Web","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"15 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/what-makes-soup-soup/categories/workshop/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Workshop","type":"categories"},{"content":"The Heritage Science Ontology aims to formalize the knowledge in the field of Heritage Science, enabling researchers, conservators, and institutions to share, analyze, and process heritage data in a structured and interoperable manner.
