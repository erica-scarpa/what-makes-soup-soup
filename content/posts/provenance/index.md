Provenance and provenience are two terms often used interchangeably, despite their distinct meanings. <strong>Provenance</strong> refers to the ownership history of a historical artifact, tracing its journey through time and the various hands that have held it. In contrast, <strong>provenience</strong> specifically denotes the findspot—the exact physical location where the artifact was discovered. While provenance logically encompasses provenience, it also extends further, including details about the artifact's custody and the transitions it may have undergone throughout its history.
