On January 16-17, 2025, a two-day round table will be held in Venice. The main topic will be the application of Semantic Web (SW) technologies in the wider field of Heritage Science. A panel of domain experts - coming from archaeological, historical, and epigraphic disciplines - and knowledge engineers will participate. The discussion will be centered on the potential of applying SW technologies to large archaeological, historical, and epigraphic datasets. This is the first meeting devoted to fostering collaboration in building an ontology for Heritage Science. Further meetings will be held, including domain experts working with Heritage coming from the natural sciences.
