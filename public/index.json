Joyce (2012) provides a clear depiction of the scholarly community\u0026rsquo;s position on this topic. The two words have become associated with the perspectives of scholars from two different disciplines: art history and archaeology. These terms are also central to the ongoing debate over illegal antiquities.\nProvenance # Provenance, a concept embraced by art historians, refers to the ownership history of a historical artifact. It traces the artifact’s journey from its place of discovery through time, including the various hands that have held it (Brodie et al., 2013, p. 15). While provenance ideally begins with the object\u0026rsquo;s creation, in practice, it often starts at the point of the artifact\u0026rsquo;s removal from its archaeological context. The term is frequently used as a synonym for an object\u0026rsquo;s chain of custody. Bedford (2020, p. 415) offers a detailed and well-articulated definition of provenance:\nChain of custody is often referred to as provenance outside the legal and business environments. Provenance is defined as the chronology of ownership, custody, or location of an object, document, or group of documents, over its full history. The primary purpose of tracing the provenance of an object or entity is to provide contextual and circumstantial evidence for its original production or discovery, by establishing, as far as practicable, its later history, especially the sequences of its formal ownership, custody, and place of storage. Having detailed evidence of provenance can establish that an asset is what it purports to be, that it has not been altered or stolen and is not a forgery. Moral an legal validity of a chain of custody is important where forgeries, fakes, and reproductions are common in cases of theft, misappropriation, or \u0026rsquo;looted\u0026rsquo; assets.\nProvenience # Provenience is a term predominantly used within the archaeological community to denote the findspot—the exact physical location where an artifact was discovered. Provenience is considered as a three-dimensional location in space (Joyce 2012, 49). The debate surrounding the handling of illegal antiquities has significantly influenced how the concepts of provenance and provenience are interpreted and applied.\nWhile provenance logically encompasses provenience, it also extends further, including details about the artifact\u0026rsquo;s custody and the transitions it may have undergone throughout its history.\nPriceBurton2011\nThe author further suggests that well documented provenance consists of at least two things: a chronology of the asset\u0026rsquo;s transfers from its discovery to the present day, and the group of all the unstructured notes that contextualize the custody information asserted in the chronology.\nAuthentication is the process of documenting –and possibly proving— the identity of an asset. Bedford identifies three authentication methods that are common to fields interested in making available or accessible an asset, whether it is physical or digital, from the legal field to real state, up to history and archaeology: inherent authenticity, demonstrated or inferred authenticity, and documented authenticity. In the case of inherent authenticity, the asset can be indentified as authentic based on direct observation, based on its inherent qualities. Demonstrated or inferred authenticity involves instead a deliberate effort to asset the asset\u0026rsquo;s identity: this involves the validation of the asset\u0026rsquo;s identity throught an external source. Finally, documented authenticity relies on external documents such as chain of custody, stamps, watermarks, or certifications. Provenience is one of such documents\nAuthenticity is additive, in the sense that more than one piece of information might be necessary to estrablish an asset\u0026rsquo;s identity through authentication.\nBibliography # Bedford, Denise. 2020.

The main topic will be the application of Semantic Web (SW) technologies in the wider field of Heritage Science. A panel of domain experts - coming from archaeological, historical, and epigraphic disciplines - and knowledge engineers will participate. The discussion will be centered on the potential of applying SW technologies to large archaeological, historical, and epigraphic datasets. This is the first meeting devoted to fostering collaboration in building an ontology for Heritage Science. Further meetings will be held, including domain experts working with Heritage coming from the natural sciences.\nFor further information, see this link.\nThe post featured image is from Tableaux accomplis de tous les arts liberaux by Christofle de Savigny (ca 1530-1608) gallica.bnf.fr / Bibliothèque nationale de France.\n","date":"15 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/what-makes-soup-soup/posts/round-table-venice/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Heritage Science and Semantic Web - Venice Round Table","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"15 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/what-makes-soup-soup/tags/semantic-web/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Semantic Web","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"15 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/what-makes-soup-soup/categories/workshop/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Workshop","type":"categories"},{"content":"The Heritage Science Ontology aims to formalize the knowledge in the field of Heritage Science, enabling researchers, conservators, and institutions to share, analyze, and process heritage data in a structured and interoperable manner.
